This script call for  ruby and the gem json [gem install json]

These are not necessary - you can parse json any way you want, but you can't use
my script if you don't have these.

Downloading from echo 360 center is a pain
here is a hack to get the files you need
first locate the sectionid of the course you want to download.
Example: http://recordings.engineering.illinois.edu/ess/portal/section/7dc02000-0660-4eb9-9e7c-5134ff084e5d

the section id here is: 7dc02000-0660-4eb9-9e7c-5134ff084e5d

next go here

http://recordings.engineering.illinois.edu/ess/client/api/sections/7dc02000-0660-4eb9-9e7c-5134ff084e5d/section-data.json?pageIndex=1&pageSize=1000

notice the section id in the url - replace this with your section id.
place the section id into data.json in the same directory as this script

Now I will get you the links of all the videos to download.

You can now use your favorite download manager to download all the things

I recommend doing the following. 

Install aria2c - a multipart multconnection download manager
mkdir stuff
touch stuff/media.m4v
aria2c -j16 -x16 -X -i output -d stuff


This will download all the files very quickly. DONT DO THIS ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER
- unless you have fast up speed or want the files on your own computer. I
  recommend storing this in the cloud - s3. So you probably want something that
  gives you fast up link like ews or digitalocean.

once you have the downloads - you may want to clean it by trimming the part that
you dont want.

for example
ffmpeg -i 1.m4v -y -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss  00:14:50 -t 01:33:00 _1.m4v

will get you the part between 00:14:50 to 01:33:00

you may even play around with compression

ffmpeg -i 1.m4v -c copy -c:v libx264 -crf 40 -preset ultrafast 1-lq.mp4

# you can get ffmpeg form here http://johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/

now upload to s3 with something like s3cmd

so apt-get install s3cmd and 
s3cmd sync -Pr --skip-existing stuff --continue s3://uiuc-courses/DataStructures.225.2013.CindaHeeran

and now you can watch the lectures from anywhere. 

Enjoy.
